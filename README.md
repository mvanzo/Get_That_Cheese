# Get That Cheese
### A One Player Game

It's night and the humans have gone to bed. You're a mouse and you're hungry for cheese crumbles, which the messy homeowners have all over their floor. Go get it! Only problem is...the cats...and there's two of them trying get you before you get that cheese. You only have so much time to gobble all the cheese you can get your hands on so get busy.

Using the arrow controls on your keyboard, move the mouse to pick up as many cheese crumbles as you you can while avoiding running into the cats and get to your mouse hole before the time runs out.
