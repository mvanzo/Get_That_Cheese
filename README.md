# Get That Cheese
### A One Player Game

It's night and the humans have gone to bed. You're a mouse and you're hungry for cheese crumbles, which the messy homeowners have all over their house. Go get it! Only problem is...the cats..and there's a lot of them trying get you before you get that cheese. You only have so much time to gobble all the cheese you can get your hands on so get busy.

# MVP
* Functional start/end menu with a button to start new game
* Moveable player used to collect squares
    * Keep track of number collected
* Game map to travel through
* Timer that counts down, ends gameplay
* Mouse hole at end of map

# Stretch Goals
* Start/end menu keeps track of last score, highest score
* Game map with different obstacles that will block movement
* Mouse hole at end of map gives extra points for time left on the clock
* Soundbite of "Get That Cheese" by Too $hort that plays whenever you get that cheese! -- or at the end game screen -- copyright issue?
* Enemy cats that move along y-axis or x-axis and if touched, ends gameplay
    * AI cats to actively hunt down the mouse

# Potential Roadblocks
* Large map to travel throught that is controlled by player movement
* Collision detection for objects that aren't perfect squares
* Too $hort probably won't let me use his music for this game

# Tech Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Canvas
* Possibly Bootstrap for styling
